# ReduxBlogBoilerPlate

### Getting Started

This boilerplate is built from my lesson from Udemy by https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git. I found this a great place to start learning React and would definitely recommend StephenGrider's course. They are very clear and precise and can take no time at all to get building cool apps.

### Documentation

I have created a Node API that can be used with this React presentation layer. To clone the repo follow the link - https://github.com/richgurney/NodeJWTAuthAPI. I have used JWT and Bcrypt to authenticate the api to prepare it for production.

```
> git clone https://github.com/richgurney/ReduxBlogBoilerPlate.git
> cd ReduxBlogBoilerPlate
> npm install
> npm start
```
