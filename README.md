# ReduxBlogBoilerPlate

### Getting Started

This boilerplate is built from my lesson from Udemy by https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git. I found this a great place to start learning React and would definitely recommend StephenGrider's course. They are very clear and precise and can take no time at all to get building cool apps.

### Documentation

> https://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/   

There is really great Documentation here for the api that this app is built around. You can simply swap out this out for your API at a later date.
